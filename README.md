##AI-Assisted Carbon Storage Site Predictor üåçüí®

### Summary

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is important for reaching net-zero goals, and Shell is putting money into big CCS projects around the world. Finding good underground spots to store captured CO‚ÇÇ can be hard and take a lot of resources.

This project offers a Carbon Storage Site Predictor that uses AI. It uses machine learning and location data to judge and rank possible CO‚ÇÇ storage places. The predictor looks at things like geology, environment, and infrastructure to give a score to each site showing how good it is for storage.

### Features

*   **Data Integration:** Uses information like rock types, depth, well spacing, and distance to pollution sources.
*   **Machine Learning:** Uses models to guess how good a site is.
*   **Decision Support:** Gives a ranked list of possible CCS sites, so decisions can be made faster and based on data.
*   **Cost &amp; Time Saving:** Lowers early costs and speeds up studying if a site will work.
*   **Sustainability:** Helps the shift to green energy and fits with Shell‚Äôs plans for green tech.

### How It Works

1.  **Data Collection:** Get data on geology, environment, and infrastructure.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Clean up the data to get it ready for the model.
3.  **Model Training:** Teach machine learning models to guess how good a site is.
4.  **Prediction &amp; Ranking:** Give scores to possible CCS sites to show how good they are.
5.  **Decision Support:** Look at and study the best-ranked spots.

### Tools Used

*   Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
*   Location tools (Geopandas, Folium)
*   Data charts (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Result

A test tool to help find good CCS sites faster, lowering the need for lots of manual checks. It shows how AI can help with sustainable energy options.
